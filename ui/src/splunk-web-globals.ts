/*
 * Page globals that Splunk Web defines and that @splunk/visualizations expects
 * to find.
 *
 * The charting bundle underneath the visualization library is the same code
 * Splunk Web ships, and it reads a couple of things off `window` that Splunk
 * Web's page bootstrap puts there. Stoker's console is not served by Splunk
 * Web, so nothing puts them there and the bundle throws on import:
 *
 *   TypeError: window.locale_name is not a function
 *
 * These are the smallest honest definitions of them. They are set in a module
 * imported before anything that reaches the chart library, because the bundle
 * reads them while it is being evaluated rather than when a chart is first
 * drawn: a shim applied after the import is a shim applied too late.
 *
 * Anything already defined is left alone, so this cannot break the case where
 * a future build of the console is served from inside Splunk Web after all.
